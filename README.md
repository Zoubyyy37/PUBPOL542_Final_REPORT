# PUBPOL542_Final_REPORT

This GitHub repository contains five files, including one Jupyter Python Notebook and corresponding html file for preprocessing the data, one R Markdown Notebook and corresponding html file for data analysis, and a pdf version version of the final report. 

In these files, the html ones show all the code and interpretation, just like what our slides do. If you want to focus on the text version, you can look at the PDF version.
